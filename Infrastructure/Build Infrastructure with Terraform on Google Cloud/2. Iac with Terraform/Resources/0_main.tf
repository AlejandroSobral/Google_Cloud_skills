#The terraform {} block is required so Terraform knows which provider to download from the Terraform Registry. In the configuration above, the google provider's source is defined as hashicorp/google which is shorthand for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google.
#You can also assign a version to each provider defined in the required_providers block. The version argument is optional, but recommended. It is used to constrain the provider to a specific version or a range of versions in order to prevent downloading a new provider that may possibly contain breaking changes. 
#If the version isn't specified, Terraform automatically downloads the most recent provider during initialization.
